Statistical plots with Seaborn

This is a high-level tour of the seaborn plotting library for producing statistical graphics in Python. We’ll cover seaborn tools for computing and visualizing linear regressions, as well as tools for visualizing univariate distributions (like strip, swarm, and violin plots) and multivariate distributions (like joint plots, pair plots, and heatmaps). We’ll also discuss grouping categories in plots.
